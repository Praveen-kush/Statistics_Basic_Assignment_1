Each level of measurement has different implications for aggregation, comparison, and mathematical operations.\n",

    "**Example**: Consider a dataset containing the **ages** of a group of people, which is a **ratio level** of measurement. Knowing that age is at the ratio level allows us to calculate meaningful statistics such as the mean, median, mode, range, and standard deviation. We can also make comparisons like \"Person A is twice as old as Person B\" because the ratio level has a true zero point (indicating the absence of age) and equal intervals.\n",
